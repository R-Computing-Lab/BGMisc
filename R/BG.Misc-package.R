#' Behavior Genetic Graphing in R
#'
#' @description
#' The classic behavior genetic model uses data from twins to decompose sources of phenotypic variation into the broad categories of genetic (a^2; Additive), environmental (c^2; Shared), and unique (e^2; Non-Shared) variance. The primary aim of this research is to describe the relative influence of genes and the environment on virtually every phenotype. It is used across a range of disciplines from psychology to economics.
#'
#' The \code{BG.Misc} package extends the popular \code{\link[=ggplot]{ggplot2}} package. ggplot2 implements Wilkinsons
#' "The Grammar of Graphics", and, makes provision for a highly methodical construction process for the development
#' of meaningful (graphical) data representations. Of course, the above book by Wilkinson outlines the \emph{theory},
#' whilst Hadley Wickhams \code{\link[=ggplot]{ggplot2}} implementation is where much of the magic happens,
#' and, an ideal base-platform for the \code{ggbg} package.
#'
#' In this document, some of the main features are highlighted, however, current examples (and corresponding outputs)
